#This file must have the same number of non-commented strings with the file ases_names
#Each line in this file must correlate with corresponding line in the file ases_names!!! (Or program will count wrong results!)
#Test:
# this file is created for basic test, so I'm not using RIBs here
# also I'm not using generated ases files. So files with updates contain some ases not listed in files with ases!
